<h3>Aplicattion developed by Francesc Madrona</h3>

The aim of this project is to develop a simple order aplication for Freshly Cosmetics.

The problem to solve is simplifying the organitzation about the orders to deliver.

The application show a table with all the orders, sorted by Country Name, and pre-selected with the "PreparaciÃ³n en proceso" order status.
The application also allow the user to display the orders depending on the Country and the current status of the order and also to update this status.
Finally, there is onle simple button at the top of the table to show that the aplication also can add new orders from the web-side,
and are automatically added to the DataBase and displayed.

The stack used for this application has been MYSQL for the database, NODE.JS for the Backend, and VUE.JS for the Frontend.
As the application had to be delivered in a short time, this stack fits perfectlly when developing a simple application fastly.
